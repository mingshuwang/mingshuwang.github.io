# Biography

Dr. Mingshu Wang (王明舒) is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in **Geospatial Data Science**  at the [School of Geographical & Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/). His research focuses on developing and applying methods of **GIScience** (i.e., geographical information systems, remote sensing, and spatial analysis) and **big data analytics** (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, and econometrics) to understand **urban systems**. He has two interconnected research lines of cities from the perspective of **people**. At a macro-scale, he quantifies the relationship between urban structure and urban/regional performance from fine-grained geospatial data via GIScience and econometrics methods. At a micro-scale, he examines human mobility issues regarding the built environment with crowdsourced geospatial information using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. He has received research grants from the World Bank, Dutch Research Council (NWO), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Microsoft Azure Research Award.
